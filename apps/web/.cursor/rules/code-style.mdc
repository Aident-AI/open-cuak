# Your rule content

- Modify ONLY the needed parts and follow the principle of writing as little code and making as little change as possible.
- Do NOT add comment unless it is essential to explain how a piece of code is working. ALWAYS follow the rule of writing self-explaining code.
- Do NOT use terminal, since most of the tests will be done in a remote server.
